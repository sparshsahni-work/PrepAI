## Known Limitations

- PDF generation via Puppeteer requires `--no-sandbox` flags when deployed on Render.
- Job scraping is limited to Remotive and Arbeitnow APIs — scraping-based sources are blocked on Render's free tier.
- The token blacklist has no TTL index, so expired tokens accumulate in the database over time.
